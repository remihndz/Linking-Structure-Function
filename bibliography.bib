  abstract  = {Age related macular degeneration is a major cause of blindness and visual impairment in older adults. Its exudative form, where ﬂuids leak into the macula, is especially damaging. The standard treatment involves injections of anti-VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) agents into the eye, which prevent further vascular growth and leakage, and can restore vision. These intravitreal injections have a risk of devastating complications including blindness from infection and are expensive. Optimizing the interval between injections in a patient speciﬁc manner is of great interest, as the retinal response is partially patientspeciﬁc. In this paper we propose a machine learning approach to predict the retinal response at the end of a standardized 12-week induction phase of the treatment. From a longitudinal series of optical coherence tomography (OCT) images, a number of quantitative measurements are extracted, describing the underlying retinal structure and pathology and its response to initial treatment. After initial feature selection, the selected set of features is used to predict the treatment response status at the end of the induction phase using the support vector machine classiﬁer. On a population of 30 patients, leave-one-out cross-validation showed the classiﬁcation success rate of 87\% of predicting whether the subject will show a response to the treatment at the next visit. The proposed methodology is a promising step towards the much needed image-guided prediction of patient-speciﬁc treatment response.},

  abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this study was to predict low and high anti-VEGF injection requirements during a pro re nata (PRN) treatment, based on sets of optical coherence tomography (OCT) images acquired during the initiation phase in neovascular AMD.
Methods: Two-year clinical trial data of subjects receiving PRN ranibizumab according to protocol specified criteria in the HARBOR study after three initial monthly injections were included. OCT images were analyzed at baseline, month 1, and month 2. Quantitative spatio-temporal features computed from automated segmentation of retinal layers and fluid-filled regions were used to describe the macular microstructure. In addition, best-corrected visual acuity and demographic characteristics were included. Patients were grouped into low and high treatment categories based on first and third quartile, respectively. Random forest classification was used to learn and predict treatment categories and was evaluated with cross-validation.
Results: Of 317 evaluable subjects, 71 patients presented low (≤5), 176 medium, and 70 high (≥16) injection requirements during the PRN maintenance phase from month 3 to month 23. Classification of low and high treatment requirement subgroups demonstrated an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.7 and 0.77, respectively. The most relevant feature for prediction was subretinal fluid volume in the central 3 mm, with the highest predictive values at month 2.
Conclusions: We proposed and evaluated a machine learning methodology to predict anti-VEGF treatment needs from OCT scans taken during treatment initiation. The results of this pilot study are an important step toward image-guided prediction of treatment intervals in the management of neovascular AMD.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) treatment of neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a highly effective advance in the retinal armentarium. OCT offering 3-dimensional imaging of the retina is widely used to guide treatment. Although poor outcomes reported from clinical practice are multifactorial, availability of reliable, reproducible, and quantitative evaluation tools to accurately measure the fluid response, that is, a "VEGF meter," may be a better means of monitoring and treating than the current purely qualitative evaluation used in clinical practice.
DESIGN: Post hoc analysis of a phase III, randomized, multicenter study.
PARTICIPANTS: Study eyes of 1095 treatment-naive subjects receiving pro re nata (PRN) or monthly ranibizumab therapy according to protocol-specified criteria in the HARBOR study.
METHODS: A deep learning method for localization and quantification of fluid in all retinal compartments was applied for automated segmentation of fluid with every voxel classified by a convolutional neural network (CNN). Three-dimensional volumes (nanoliters) for intraretinal fluid (IRF), subretinal fluid (SRF), and pigment epithelial detachment (PED) were determined in 24 362 volume scans obtained from 1095 patients treated over 24 months in a phase III clinical trial with randomization to 2 drug dosages (0.5 mg and 2.0 mg ranibizumab) and 2 regimens (monthly and PRN). A multivariable mixed-effects regression model was used to test for differences in fluid between the arms and for fluid/function correlation.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Fluid volume in nanoliters, structure-function as Pearson's correlation coefficient, and as a coefficient of determination (R2).
RESULTS: Fluid volumes were quantified in all visits of all patients. Automated segmentation demonstrated characteristic response patterns for each fluid compartment individually: Intraretinal fluid showed the greatest and most rapid resolution, followed by SRF and PED the least. The loading dose treatment achieved resolution of all fluid types close to the lowest levels attainable. Dosage and regimen parameters correlated directly with resulting fluid volumes. Fluid/function correlation showed a volume-dependent negative impact of IRF on vision and weak positive prognostic effect of SRF.
CONCLUSIONS: Automated quantification of the fluid response may improve therapeutic management of neovascular AMD, avoid discrepancies between clinicians/investigators, and establish structure/function correlations.},

  abstract = {Neovascular age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD) results from the pathological angiogenesis of choroidal capillaries, which leak ﬂuid within or below the macular region of the retina. The current standard of care for treating wet AMD utilizes intravitreal injections of anti-VEGF antibodies or antibody fragments to suppress ocular vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels. While VEGF suppression has been demonstrated in wet AMD patients by serial measurements of free-VEGF concentrations in aqueous humor samples, it is presumed that anti-VEGF molecules also permeate across the inner limiting membrane (ILM) of the retina as well as the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) and suppress VEGF levels in the retina and/or choroidal regions. The latter eﬀects are inferred from serial optical coherence tomography (OCT) measurements of ﬂuid in the retinal and sub-retinal spaces. In order to gain theoretical insights to the dynamics of retinal levels of free-VEGF following intravitreal injection of anti-VEGF molecules, we have extended our previous two-compartment pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) model of ranibizumab−VEGF suppression in vitreous and aqueous humors to a three-compartment model that includes the retinal compartment. In the new model, reference values for the macromolecular permeability coeﬃcients between retina and vitreous (pILM) and between retina and choroid (pRPE) were estimated from PK data obtained in rabbit. With these values, the three-compartment model was used to re-analyze the aqueous humor levels of free-VEGF obtained in wet AMD patients treated with ranibizumab and to compare them to the simulated retinal levels of free-VEGF, including the observed variability in PK and PD. We have also used the model to explore the impact of varying pILM and pRPE to assess the case in which an anti-VEGF molecule is impermeable to the ILM and to assess the potential eﬀects of AMD pathology on the RPE barrier. Our simulations show that, for the reference values of pILM and pRPE, the simulated duration of VEGF suppression in the retina is approximately 50\% shorter than the observed duration of VEGF suppression in the aqueous humor, a ﬁnding that may explain the short duration of suppressed disease activity in the “high anti-VEGF demand” patients reported by Fauser and Muether (Br. J. Ophthalmol. 2016, 100, 1494−1498). At 10-fold lower values of pRPE, the durations of VEGF suppression in the retina and aqueous humor are comparable. Lastly we have used the model to explore the impact of dose and binding parameters on the duration and depth of VEGF suppression in the aqueous and retinal compartments. Our simulations with the three-compartment PK/PD model provide new insights into inter-patient variability in response to anti-VEGF therapy and oﬀer a mechanistic framework for developing treatment regimens and molecules that may prolong the duration of retinal VEGF suppression.},

  abstract   = {The development of anti-angiogenic drugs for cancer therapy has yielded some promising candidates, but novel approaches for interventions to angiogenesis have led to disappointing results. In addition, there is a shortage of biomarkers that are predictive of response to anti-angiogenic treatments. Consequently, the complex biochemical and physiological basis for tumour angiogenesis remains incompletely understood. We have adopted a mathematical approach to address these issues, formulating a spatially averaged multiscale model that couples the dynamics of VEGF, Ang1, Ang2 and PDGF, with those of mature and immature endothelial cells and pericyte cells. The model reproduces qualitative experimental results regarding pericyte coverage of vessels after treatment by anti-Ang2, anti-VEGF and combination anti-VEGF/anti-Ang2 antibodies. We used the steady state behaviours of the model to characterise angiogenic and non-angiogenic vascular phenotypes, and used mechanistic perturbations representing hypothetical anti-angiogenic treatments to generate testable hypotheses regarding transitions to non-angiogenic phenotypes that depend on the pre-treatment vascular phenotype. Additionally, we predicted a synergistic effect between anti-VEGF and anti-Ang2 treatments when applied to an immature pre-treatment vascular phenotype, but not when applied to a normalised angiogenic pre-treatment phenotype. Based on these findings, we conclude that changes in vascular phenotype are predicted to be useful as an experimental biomarker of response to treatment. Further, our analysis illustrates the potential value of non-spatial mathematical models for generating tractable predictions regarding the action of anti-angiogenic therapies.},

To determine correlations between the location of neuronal subcellular compartments and the morphometric features of regional capillary networks in the layered retina.

Novel micropipette technology was used to cannulate the central retinal artery and label the retinal microcirculation using a phalloidin perfusate. γ-synuclein, Goα, and parvalbumin antibodies were also used to co-localize the nerve fiber layer (NFL), retinal ganglion cell layer (RGCL), inner plexiform layer (IPL), and inner nuclear layer (INL). Confocal scanning laser microscopy was used for capillary imaging. Capillary diameter, capillary density, and capillary loop area measurements were compared between networks.    Four capillary networks were identified in the following retinal layers: (1) NFL, (2) RGCL and superficial portion of IPL, (3) deep portion of IPL and superficial portion of INL, and (4) deep portion of INL. Laminar configurations were present in NFL and deep INL networks. Remaining networks demonstrated three-dimensional configurations. Capillary density was greatest in the networks serving the IPL. Capillary loop area was smallest in the two innermost networks. There was no difference in capillary diameter between networks.    Capillary networks in the human perifovea are morphometrically heterogeneous. Morphometric features of regional capillary networks in the layered retina may serve a critical role in supporting neuronal homeostasis.

Methods: The parafoveal microvasculature was perfused and labeled in 16 normal human donor eyes for lectin, alpha smooth muscle actin, and filamentous actin. Established structural criteria gathered using confocal microscopy, including vessel diameter, endothelial cell morphology, and presence/density of smooth muscle cells, were used to differentiate arteries, arterioles, capillaries, venules, and veins. Three-dimensional visualization strategies were used to define the connections between retinal arteries and veins within the superficial vascular plexus (SVP), intermediate capillary plexus (ICP), and deep capillary plexus (DCP).
Results: The parafoveal microvasculature has two different inflow patterns and seven different outflow patterns. The SVP and ICP were connected to retinal arteries by arterioles. Inflow into the DCP occurred only via small arterioles (a1; mean diameter, 8.3 µm) that originated from the ICP. Direct connections between the DCP and retinal arteries were not identified. Each capillary plexus formed its own venule that drained independently or in conjunction with venules from other plexuses into a retinal vein at the level of the ganglion cell layer. For the DCP, a1 was significantly smaller than its draining venule (mean diameter, 18.8 µm; P {\textless} 0.001).
Conclusions: The SVP and ICP of the parafoveal microvasculature have both in series and in parallel arterial and venous connections. Arterial supply to the DCP originates from the ICP, but with direct drainage to the retinal vein. These findings may help to develop an understanding of the pattern of retinal lesions characterizing a myriad of retinal vascular diseases.},

subretinal fibrosis increased approximately 1.21-fold (p = 0.03) at the 
final follow-up. Conclusions: The progression of neovascular remodeling 
and subretinal fibrosis may serve as biomarkers to predict incomplete response to 
anti-VEGF therapy in patients with NVAMD. Subretinal fibrosis complicating NVAMD 
remains a major obstacle for the management of NVAMD, and anti-VEGF treatment is 
a potential therapeutic strategy to target neovascular remodeling and subretinal 
fibrosis as either an additive or alternative therapeutic approach for NVAMD.},

  abstract = {Purpose:The purpose of this study was to quantitatively investigate the haemodynamics and oxygen transmission of the retina.Methods:Considering the effect of Fåhraeus-Lindqvist effect on the apparent viscosity of blood and the actual haematocrit in blood vessels, this study used the currently known retinal parameters (e.g. blood flow obtained by Doppler Fourier domain optical coherence tomography, FD-OCT for short) to construct a retinal blood circulation model consisting of an asymmetric vascular network system.Results:The blood flow velocity and the vascular diameter in the retinal blood vessels satisfied the exponential relationship. The wall shear stress was related to the release of nitric oxide synthase and endothelin-1 by endothelial cells and played an important role in retinal blood flow regulation. In the retinal arteries, the oxygen tension ranged from 98 to 65?mmHg, and the oxygen saturation ranged from 97.3\% to 92.2\%. In the retinal veins, the oxygen tension was approximately 41.8?mmHg, and the oxygen saturation ranged from 79.2\% to 77.3\%. The difference in oxygen content of the arteriovenous network was 5.4 (ml?O2/dl blood), and the oxygen extraction of the superior temporal arteriovenous network was 86 (?l/min*ml?O2/dl blood).Conclusion:Compared with previous relevant experimental data, the numerical model established in this article demonstrates reliability. It also helps advance our understanding of the retinal pathological processes related to hemodynamics and metabolism.},

  abstract = {The distributions of blood velocity and volumetric flow rate in individual vessels of the normal human retina were determined as a function of vessel diameter. The mean velocity of blood, Vmean, was calculated from the centerline velocity measured by bidirectional laser Doppler velocimetry (LDV). Volumetric flow rate was determined from Vmean and the vessel diameter, D, measured from monochromatic fundus photographs. Diameter of the arteries and veins at the site of the LDV measurements ranged from 39 to 134 microns and 64 to 177 microns, respectively. Flow velocity correlated with D (P less than 0.001 for both arteries and veins). Volumetric flow rate varied with D at a power of 2.76 +/- 0.16 for arteries and 2.84 +/- 0.12 for veins, in close agreement with Murray's law. Calculated from 12 eyes, the average total arterial and venous volumetric flow rates were 33 +/- 9.6 and 34 +/- 6.3 microliters/min, respectively. The good agreement between both flow rates suggests that the technique and the assumptions for calculating flow yield results that satisfy mass conservation. Total arterial and venous volumetric flow rates correlated with total arterial and venous vessel cross-section. Volumetric flow rate in the temporal retina was significantly greater than in the nasal retina, but the difference is likely to be due to the larger area of the temporal retina. No difference in flow rate was observed between the superior and inferior retinal hemispheres. Finally, blood velocity in the major retinal vessels measured under normal experimental conditions appears remarkably constant over short (hours) and long (months) periods of time.},

  abstract = {There is currently limited understanding of the role played by haemodynamic forces on the processes governing vascular development. One of many obstacles to be overcome is being able to measure those forces, at the required resolution level, on vessels only a few micrometres thick. In this paper, we present an in silico method for the computation of the haemodynamic forces experienced by murine retinal vasculature (a widely used vascular development animal model) beyond what is measurable experimentally. Our results show that it is possible to reconstruct high-resolution three-dimensional geometrical models directly from samples of retinal vasculature and that the lattice-Boltzmann algorithm can be used to obtain accurate estimates of the haemodynamics in these domains. We generate flow models from samples obtained at postnatal days (P) 5 and 6. Our simulations show important differences between the flow patterns recovered in both cases, including observations of regression occurring in areas where wall shear stress (WSS) gradients exist. We propose two possible mechanisms to account for the observed increase in velocity and WSS between P5 and P6: (i) the measured reduction in typical vessel diameter between both time points and (ii) the reduction in network density triggered by the pruning process. The methodology developed herein is applicable to other biomedical domains where microvasculature can be imaged but experimental flow measurements are unavailable or difficult to obtain.},

  abstract = {Elevated intraocular pressure is the primary risk factor for glaucoma, yet vascular health and ocular hemodynamics have also been established as important risk factors for the disease. The precise physiological mechanisms and processes by which flow impairment and reduced tissue oxygenation relate to retinal ganglion cell death are not fully known. Mathematical modeling has emerged as a useful tool to help decipher the role of hemodynamic alterations in glaucoma. Several previous models of the retinal microvasculature and tissue have investigated the individual impact of spatial heterogeneity, flow regulation, and oxygen transport on the system. This study combines all three of these components into a heterogeneous mathematical model of retinal arterioles that includes oxygen transport and acute flow regulation in response to changes in pressure, shear stress, and oxygen demand. The metabolic signal (Si) is implemented as a wall-derived signal that reflects the oxygen deficit along the network, and three cases of conduction are considered: no conduction, a constant signal, and a flow-weighted signal. The model shows that the heterogeneity of the downstream signal serves to regulate flow better than a constant conducted response. In fact, the increases in average tissue PO2 due to a flow-weighted signal are often more significant than if the entire level of signal is increased. Such theoretical work supports the importance of the non-uniform structure of the retinal vasculature when assessing the capability and/or dysfunction of blood flow regulation in the retinal microcirculation.},

  abstract   = {The scientific community continues to accrue evidence that blood flow alterations and ischemic conditions in the retina play an important role in the pathogenesis of ocular diseases. Many factors influence retinal hemodynamics and tissue oxygenation, including blood pressure, blood rheology, oxygen arterial permeability and tissue metabolic demand. Since the influence of these factors on the retinal circulation is difficult to isolate in vivo, we propose here a novel mathematical and computational model describing the coupling between blood flow mechanics and oxygen (\$\${\textbackslash}hbox \{O\}\_2\$\$) transport in the retina. Albeit in a simplified manner, the model accounts for the three-dimensional anatomical structure of the retina, consisting in a layered tissue nourished by an arteriolar/venular network laying on the surface proximal to the vitreous. Capillary plexi, originating from terminal arterioles and converging into smaller venules, are embedded in two distinct tissue layers. Arteriolar and venular networks are represented by fractal trees, whereas capillary plexi are represented using a simplified lumped description. In the model, \$\${\textbackslash}hbox \{O\}\_2\$\$is transported along the vasculature and delivered to the tissue at a rate that depends on the metabolic demand of the various tissue layers. First, the model is validated against available experimental results to identify baseline conditions. Then, a sensitivity analysis is performed to quantify the influence of blood pressure, blood rheology, oxygen arterial permeability and tissue oxygen demand on the \$\${\textbackslash}hbox \{O\}\_2\$\$distribution within the blood vessels and in the tissue. This analysis shows that: (1) systemic arterial blood pressure has a strong influence on the \$\${\textbackslash}hbox \{O\}\_2\$\$profiles in both blood and tissue; (2) plasma viscosity and metabolic consumption rates have a strong influence on the \$\${\textbackslash}hbox \{O\}\_2\$\$tension at the level of the retinal ganglion cells; and (3) arterial \$\${\textbackslash}hbox \{O\}\_2\$\$permeability has a strong influence on the \$\${\textbackslash}hbox \{O\}\_2\$\$saturation in the retinal arterioles.},

  abstract = {The retinal tissue is highly metabolically active and is responsible for translating the visual stimuli into electrical signals to be delivered to the brain. A complex vascular structure ensures an adequate supply of blood and oxygen, which is essential for the function and survival of the retinal tissue. To date, a complete understanding of the configuration of the retinal vascular structures is still lacking. Optical coherence tomography angiography has made available a huge amount of imaging data regarding the main retinal capillary plexuses, namely the superficial capillary plexuses (SCP), intermediate capillary plexuses (ICP) and deep capillary plexuses (DCP). However, the interpretation of these data is still controversial. In particular, the question of whether the three capillary plexuses are connected in series or in parallel remains a matter of debate. In this work, we address this question by utilizing a multi-scale/multi-physics mathematical model to quantify the impact of the two hypothesized vascular configurations on retinal hemodynamics and oxygenation. The response to central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) and intraocular pressure (IOP) elevation is also simulated depending on whether the capillary plexuses are connected in series or in parallel. The simulation results show the following: (i) in the in series configuration, the plexuses exhibit a differential response, with DCP and ICP experiencing larger pressure drops than SCP; and (ii) in the in parallel configuration, the blood flow redistributes uniformly in the three plexuses. The different vascular configurations show different responses also in terms of oxygen profiles: (i) in the in series configuration, the outer nuclear layer, outer plexiform layer and inner nuclear layer (INL) are those most affected by CRVO and IOP elevation; and (ii) in the in parallel configuration the INL and ganglion cell layer are those most affected. The in series results are consistent with studies on paracentral acute middle maculopathy, secondary to CRVO and with studies on IOP elevation, in which DCP and ICP and the retinal tissues surrounding them are those most affected by ischemia. These findings seem to suggest that the in series configuration better describes the physiology of the vascular retinal capillary network in health and disease.},

In this research cell resolved blood flow simulations are used to study the pulsatile flow of whole blood through a segmented retinal microaneurysm. Images were collected using adaptive optics optical coherence tomography of the retina of a patient with diabetic retinopathy, and a sidewall (sacciform) microaneurysm was segmented from the volumetric data. The original microaneurysm neck width was varied to produce two additional aneurysm geometries in order to probe the influence of neck width on the transport of red blood cells and platelets into the aneurysm. Red blood cell membrane stiffness was also increased to resolve the impact of rigid red blood cells, as a result of diabetes, in blood flow. Wall shear stress and wall shear stress gradients were calculated throughout the aneurysm domains, and the quantification of the influence of the red blood cells is presented. Average wall shear stress and wall shear stress gradients increased due to the increase of red blood cell membrane stiffness. Stiffened red blood cells were also found to induce higher local wall shear stress and wall shear stress gradients as they passed through the leading and draining parental vessels. Stiffened red blood cells were found to penetrate the aneurysm sac more than healthy red blood cells, as well as decreasing the margination of platelets to the vessel walls of the parental vessel, which caused a decrease in platelet penetration into the aneurysm sac.},

  abstract   = {PURPOSE: This study investigates the relationship between intraocular pressure (IOP) and retinal hemodynamics and predicts how arterial blood pressure (BP) and blood flow autoregulation (AR) influence this relationship.
METHODS: A mathematical model is developed to simulate blood flow in the central retinal vessels and retinal microvasculature as current flowing through a network of resistances and capacitances. Variable resistances describe active and passive diameter changes due to AR and IOP. The model is validated by using clinically measured values of retinal blood flow and velocity. The model simulations for six theoretical patients with high, normal, and low BP (HBP-, NBP-, LBP-) and functional or absent AR (-wAR, -woAR) are compared with clinical data.
RESULTS: The model predicts that NBPwAR and HBPwAR patients can regulate retinal blood flow (RBF) as IOP varies between 15 and 23 mm Hg and between 23 and 29 mm Hg, respectively, whereas LBPwAR patients do not adequately regulate blood flow if IOP is 15 mm Hg or higher. Hemodynamic alterations would be noticeable only if IOP changes occur outside of the regulating range, which, most importantly, depend on BP. The model predictions are consistent with clinical data for IOP reduction via surgery and medications and for cases of induced IOP elevation.
CONCLUSIONS: The theoretical model results suggest that the ability of IOP to induce noticeable changes in retinal hemodynamics depends on the levels of BP and AR of the individual. These predictions might help to explain the inconsistencies found in the clinical literature concerning the relationship between IOP and retinal hemodynamics.},

To analyze this mechanism, a theoretical model is used to simulate the variation of oxygen and ATP levels along a flow pathway of seven representative segments, including two vasoactive arteriolar segments. The conducted response signal is defined by integrating the ATP concentration along the vascular pathway, assuming exponential decay of the signal in the upstream direction with a length constant of ∼1 cm. Arteriolar tone depends on the conducted metabolic signal and on local wall shear stress and wall tension. Arteriolar diameters are calculated based on vascular smooth muscle mechanics. The model predicts that conducted responses stimulated by ATP release in venules and propagated to arterioles can account for increases in perfusion in response to increased oxygen demand that are consistent with experimental findings at low to moderate oxygen consumption rates. Myogenic and shear-dependent responses are found to act in opposition to this mechanism of metabolic flow regulation.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To analyze the clinical features of refractory age-related macular degeneration (AMD) patients associated with the response to three consecutive loading doses of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).
METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed on typical exudative AMD patients treated by three consecutive anti-VEGF injections. The patients were divided into a group without residual fluid on optical coherence tomography (OCT) images (Group 1) and a group with residual fluid (Group 2). We analyzed qualitative and quantitative morphological features of OCT and OCT angiography (OCTA). We performed univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses to identify factors associated with the treatment response.
RESULTS: We enrolled a total of 90 patients (Group 1: n = 60 , Group 2: n = 30). Under OCT, the choroidal thickness (CT) differed significantly between groups 1 and 2 (246.60 ± 67.67 vs. 286.90 ± 40.92 µm, p = 0.001). Under OCTA, The presence of branching (48.3\% vs. 73.3\%, p = 0.024), loops (31.7\% vs. 66.7\%, p = 0.002) and a peripheral arcade (40.0\% vs. 76.7\%, p = 0.001) differed significantly. Logistic regression analysis showed that the initial CT (B = 0.012; p = 0.007), presence of loops (B = 1.289; p = 0.015) and peripheral arcade (B = 1.483; p = 0.008) significantly affected the anti-VEGF treatment response.
CONCLUSIONS: A thicker choroid and the presence of loops and a peripheral arcade were significantly associated with a poorer response to three loading anti-VEGF injections in typical exudative AMD patients.},

  abstract = {Purpose
To measure the distance between the optic disc center and the fovea (DFD) and to assess its associations.

Methods
The population-based cross-sectional Beijing Eye Study 2011 included 3468 individuals aged 50+ years. The DFD was measured on fundus photographs.

Results
Readable fundus photographs were available for 2836 (81.8\%) individuals. Mean DFD was 4.76 ± 0.34mm (median: 4.74 mm; range: 3.76–6.53mm). In multivariate analysis, longer DFD was associated with longer axial length (P{\textless}0.001; standardized correlation coefficient beta: 0.62), higher prevalence of axially high myopia (P{\textless}0.001; beta:0.06), shallower anterior chamber depth (P{\textless}0.001; beta:-0.18), thinner lens thickness (P = 0.004; beta: -0.06), smaller optic disc-fovea angle (P = 0.02; beta: -0.04), larger parapapillary alpha zone (P = 0.008; beta: 0.05), larger parapapillary beta/gamma zone (P{\textless}0.001; beta: 0.11), larger optic disc area (P{\textless}0.001; beta: 0.08), lower degree of cortical cataract (P = 0.002; beta: -0.08), and lower prevalence of age-related macular degeneration (P = 0.001; beta: -0.06). Bruch´s membrane opening-fovea distance (DFD minus disc radius minus parapapillary beta/gamma zone width) in non-glaucomatous eyes was not significantly (P = 0.60) related with axial length in emmetropic or axially myopic eyes (axial length ≥23.5 mm), while it increased significantly (P{\textless}0.001; r: 0.32) with longer axial length in eyes with an axial length of {\textless}23.5mm. Ratio of mean DFD to disc diameter was 2.65 ± 0.30. If the ratio of disc-fovea distance to disc diameter was considered constant and if the individual disc diameter was calculated as the individual disc-fovea distance divided by the constant factor of 2.65, the resulting calculated disc diameter differed from the directly measured disc diameter by 0.16 ±0.13 mm (median: 0.13 mm, range: 0.00–0.89 mm) or 8.9 ± 7.3\% (median: 7.4\%; range: 0.00–70\%) of the measured disc diameter.

Conclusions
DFD (mean: 4.76mm) increases with longer axial length, larger parapapillary alpha zone and parapapillary beta/gamma zone, and larger disc area. The axial elongation associated increase in DFD was due to an enlargement of parapapillary beta/gamma zone while the Bruch’s membrane opening-fovea distance did not enlarge with longer axial length. This finding may be of interest for the process of emmetropization and myopization. Due to its variability, the disc-fovea distance has only limited clinical value as a relative size unit for structures at the posterior pole.},

  abstract = {The three-dimensional spatial arrangement of the cortical microcirculatory system is critical for understanding oxygen exchange between blood vessels and brain cells. A three-dimensional computer model of a 3 × 3 × 3 mm3 subsection of the human secondary cortex was constructed to quantify oxygen advection in the microcirculation, tissue oxygen perfusion, and consumption in the human cortex. This computer model accounts for all arterial, capillary and venous blood vessels of the cerebral microvascular bed as well as brain tissue occupying the extravascular space. Microvessels were assembled with optimization algorithms emulating angiogenic growth; a realistic capillary bed was built with space filling procedures. The extravascular tissue was modeled as a porous medium supplied with oxygen by advection–diffusion to match normal metabolic oxygen demand. The resulting synthetic computer generated network matches prior measured morphometrics and fractal patterns of the cortical microvasculature. This morphologically accurate, physiologically consistent, multi-scale computer network of the cerebral microcirculation predicts the oxygen exchange of cortical blood vessels with the surrounding gray matter. Oxygen tension subject to blood pressure and flow conditions were computed and validated for the blood as well as brain tissue. Oxygen gradients along arterioles, capillaries and veins agreed with in vivo trends observed recently in imaging studies within experimental tolerances and uncertainty.},

          To describe a method for measuring the diameters of large retinal blood vessels by means of spectral domain optical coherence tomography.
          Methods: 
          Prospective cohort study of 29 healthy subjects (58 eyes) who underwent a spectral domain optical coherence tomography examination. Two cubes of horizontal scans were placed at the superior and inferior borders of the disk to include the large temporal retinal vessels. Vessels diameters were measured, and an artery-to-vein ratio was calculated at 10 measurement points (480–1440 μm superiorly and inferiorly from the optic disk border).
          Results: 
          The mean age of the study subjects was 41.45 ± 15.53 years. Patients had no ocular or systemic pathologies. The mean diameter of the retinal artery was 135.73 ± 15.64 μm and of the vein 151.32 ± 15.22 μm at the measurement point of 480 μm, with a gradual decrease to 123.01 ± 13.43 μm and 137.69 ± 13.84 μm, respectively, at 1440 μm. The artery-to-vein ratio was ∼0.9 at all points of measurement.
          Conclusion: 
          This is a new noninvasive method for retinal blood vessels diameter measurement using the spectral domain optical coherence tomography imaging modality. This method may aid in evaluation of retinal and systemic vascular diseases.},

  abstract  = {Mimicking angiogenetic processes in vascular territories acquires importance in the analysis of the multi-scale circulatory cascade and the coupling between blood flow and cell function. The present work extends, in several aspects, the Constrained Constructive Optimisation (CCO) algorithm to tackle complex automatic vascularisation tasks. The main extensions are based on the integration of adaptive optimisation criteria and multi-staged space-filling strategies which enhance the modelling capabilities of CCO for specific vascular architectures. Moreover, this vascular outgrowth can be performed either from scratch or from an existing network of vessels. Hence, the vascular territory is defined as a partition of vascular, avascular and carriage domains (the last one contains vessels but not terminals) allowing one to model complex vascular domains. In turn, the multi-staged space-filling approach allows one to delineate a sequence of biologically-inspired stages during the vascularisation process by exploiting different constraints, optimisation strategies and domain partitions stage by stage, improving the consistency with the architectural hierarchy observed in anatomical structures. With these features, the aDaptive CCO (DCCO) algorithm proposed here aims at improving the modelled network anatomy. The capabilities of the DCCO algorithm are assessed with a number of anatomically realistic scenarios.},

  abstract   = {Aging or cerebral diseases may induce architectural modifications in human brain microvascular networks, such as capillary rarefaction. Such modifications limit blood and oxygen supply to the cortex, possibly resulting in energy failure and neuronal death. Modelling is key in understanding how these architectural modifications affect blood flow and mass transfers in such complex networks. However, the huge number of vessels in the human brain—tens of billions—prevents any modelling approach with an explicit architectural representation down to the scale of the capillaries. Here, we introduce a hybrid approach to model blood flow at larger scale in the brain microcirculation, based on its multiscale architecture. The capillary bed, which is a space-filling network, is treated as a porous medium and modelled using a homogenized continuum approach. The larger arteriolar and venular trees, which cannot be homogenized because of their fractal-like nature, are treated as a network of interconnected tubes with a detailed representation of their spatial organization. The main contribution of this work is to devise a proper coupling model at the interface between these two components. This model is based on analytical approximations of the pressure field that capture the strong pressure gradients building up in the capillaries connected to arterioles or venules. We evaluate the accuracy of this model for both very simple architectures with one arteriole and/or one venule and for more complex ones, with anatomically realistic tree-like vessels displaying a large number of coupling sites. We show that the hybrid model is very accurate in describing blood flow at large scales and further yields a significant computational gain by comparison with a classical network approach. It is therefore an important step towards large scale simulations of cerebral blood flow and lays the groundwork for introducing additional levels of complexity in the future.},

  abstract = {Purpose
To study the wider field (WF) swept-source OCT angiography (SS-OCTA) metrics, especially the nonperfusion area (NPA), in the diagnosing and staging of diabetic retinopathy (DR).
Design
Cross-sectional observational study (November 2018 to September 2020).
Participants
A total of 473 eyes of 286 patients (69 eyes of 49 control patients and 404 eyes of 237 diabetic patients).
Methods
We imaged using 6 × 6 mm and 12 × 12 mm angiograms on WF SS-OCTA. Images were analyzed using the ARI Network and FIJI ImageJ. Mixed effects multiple regression models and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis were used for statistical analyses.
Main Outcome Measures
Quantitative metrics such as vessel density (VD); vessel skeletonized density (VSD); foveal avascular zone (FAZ) area, circularity, and perimeter; and NPA in DR and their relative performance for its diagnosis and grading.
Results
Among patients with diabetes (median age, 59 years), 51 eyes had no DR, 185 eyes (88 mild, 97 moderate-severe) had nonproliferative DR (NPDR), and 168 eyes had proliferative DR (PDR). Trend analysis revealed a progressive decline in superficial capillary plexus (SCP) VD and VSD, and increased NPA with increasing DR severity. Additionally, there was a significant reduction in deep capillary plexus (DCP) VD and VSD in early DR (mild NPDR), but the progressive reduction in advanced DR stages was not significant. The NPA was the best parameter to diagnose DR (area under the curve [AUC], 0.96), whereas all parameters combined on both angiograms efficiently diagnosed (AUC, 0.97) and differentiated between DR stages (AUC range, 0.83–0.97). The presence of diabetic macular edema was associated with reduced SCP and DCP VD and VSD within mild NPDR eyes, whereas increased VD and VSD in SCP were observed in the moderate-severe NPDR group.
Conclusions
Our work highlights the importance of NPA, which can be measured more readily and easily with WF SS-OCTA compared with fluorescein angiography. It is quick and noninvasive, and thus can be an important adjunct for DR diagnosis and management. In our study, a combination of all OCTA metrics on both 6 × 6 mm and 12 × 12 mm angiograms had the best diagnostic accuracy for DR and its severity. Further longitudinal studies are needed to assess NPA as a biomarker for progression or regression of DR severity.},

  abstract = {A method is proposed for quantitative description of blood-vessel trees, which can be used for tree classification and/or physical parameters indirect monitoring. The method is based on texture analysis of 3D images of the trees. Several types of trees were defined, with distinct tree parameters (number of terminal branches, blood viscosity, input and output flow). A number of trees were computer-simulated for each type. 3D image was computed for each tree and its texture features were calculated. Best discriminating features were found and applied to 1-NN nearest neighbor classifier. It was demonstrated that (i) tree images can be correctly classified for realistic signal-to-noise ratio, (ii) some texture features are monotonously related to tree parameters, (iii) 2D texture analysis is not sufficient to represent the trees in the discussed sense. Moreover, applicability of texture model to quantitative description of vascularity images was also supported by unsupervised exploratory analysis. Eventually, the experimental confirmation was done, with the use of confocal microscopy images of rat brain vasculature. Several classes of brain tissue were clearly distinguished based on 3D texture numerical parameters, including control and different kinds of tumours – treated with NG2 proteoglycan to promote angiogenesis-dependent growth of the abnormal tissue. The method, applied to magnetic resonance imaging e.g. real neovasculature or retinal images can be used to support noninvasive medical diagnosis of vascular system diseases.},

The first category of methods involves the development of an anatomical model of the eye, where artificial images are generated using appropriate parameters for modelling the vascular networks and fundus. The second type of method has been made possible by the development of deep learning techniques and improvements in the performance of hardware (especially graphics cards equipped with a large number of cores). The methodology proposed here to produce high-resolution synthetic fundus images is intended to be an alternative to the increasingly widespread use of generative adversarial networks to overcome the problems that arise in producing slightly modified versions of the same real images. This will allow the simulation of pathologies and the prediction of eye-related diseases. The proposed approach is based on the principle of least action and correctly places the vessels on the simulated eye fundus without using real morphometric information. An a posteriori analysis of the average characteristics such as the size, length, bifurcations, and endpoint positioning confirmed the substantial accuracy of the proposed approach compared to real data. A graphical user interface allows the user to make any changes in real time by controlling the positions of control points.},

Here, we used a model of ischemia-reperfusion injury and found that VEGF-A exposure resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in retinal neuron apoptosis. Although mechanistic studies suggested that VEGF-A-induced volumetric blood flow to the retina may be partially responsible for the neuroprotection, ex vivo retinal culture demonstrated a direct neuroprotective effect for VEGF-A. VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR2) expression was detected in several neuronal cell layers of the retina, and functional analyses showed that VEGFR2 was involved in retinal neuroprotection. VEGF-A was also shown to be involved in the adaptive response to retinal ischemia. Ischemic preconditioning 24 hours before ischemia-reperfusion injury increased VEGF-A levels and substantially decreased the number of apoptotic retinal cells. The protective effect of ischemic preconditioning was reversed after VEGF-A inhibition. Finally, chronic inhibition of VEGF-A function in normal adult animals led to a significant loss of retinal ganglion cells yet had no observable effect on several vascular parameters. These findings have implications for both neural pathologies and ocular vascular diseases, such as diabetic retinopathy and age-related macular degeneration.},

  abstract  = {Introduction: Anti-VEGF therapy is an effective option for improving and stabilizing the vision in neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD). However, the response to treatment is markedly heterogeneous. The aim of this study was therefore to analyze the vascular characteristics of type 1,2, and 3 macular neovascularizations (MNV) in order to identify biomarkers that predict treatment response, especially with regard to changes in intraretinal and subretinal fluid. Materials and Methods: Overall, 90 treatment-naive eyes with nAMD confirmed by optic coherence tomography (OCT), fluorescein angiography, and OCT angiography (OCTA) were included in this retrospective study. The MNV detected by OCTA were subjected to quantitative vascular analysis by binarization and skeletonization of the vessel using ImageJ. We determined their area, total vascular length (sumL), fractal dimension (FD), flow density, number of vascular nodes (numN), and average vascular diameter (avgW). The results were correlated with the treatment response to the initial three injections of anti-VEGF and the changes in intraretinal (IRF) and subretinal fluid (SRF) and the occurrence of pigment epithelial detachements (PED). Results: All patients found to have no subretinal or intraretinal fluid following the initial three injections of anti-VEGF showed a significantly smaller MNV area (p {\textless} 0.001), a lower sumL (p {\textless} 0.0005), and lesser FD (p {\textless} 0.005) before treatment than those who still exhibited signs of activity. These parameters also showed a significant influence in the separate analysis of persistent SRF (p {\textless} 0.005) and a persistent PED (p {\textless} 0.05), whereas we could not detect any influence on changes in IRF. The vascular parameters avgW, numN, and flow density showed no significant influence on SRF/IRF or PED changes. Conclusions: The size, the total vessel length, and the fractal dimension of MNV at baseline are predictors for the treatment response to anti-VEGF therapy. Therefore, particularly regarding the development of new classes of drugs, these parameters could yield new insights into treatment response.},

The aim of this study was to evaluate the structural and functional changes occurring in patients with branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) according to the distance of the affected arteriovenous (AV) crossing to the centers of the fovea and optic disc by optic coherence tomography angiography (OCTA).

Methods:
Forty-five patients with unilateral BRVO and 45 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were included in this retrospective observational study. Images of the macula (3 mm × 3 mm) and affected AV crossing sites were obtained by OCTA. The fovea-AV crossing distance (FAVD), optic disc-AV crossing distance (DAVD), and optic disc-fovea distance (DFD) were measured.

Results:
The FAVD/DFD ratio was positively correlated with the vessel density in the superficial and deep affected hemifields (r = 0.430, P {\textless} 0.05 and r = 0.308, P {\textless} 0.05, respectively) and negatively correlated with the superficial foveal avascular zone and logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) visual acuity (r = –0.412, P {\textless} 0.05 and r = –0.356, P {\textless} 0.05, respectively). The DAVD/DFD ratio was not correlated with the logMAR visual acuity, superficial FAZ area or vessel densities in the affected hemifield (all P {\textgreater} 0.05).

Conclusion:
The affected AV crossing site that was further away from the fovea had better visual acuity and quantitative microvascular parameters in the affected hemifields. However, this correlation was not observed for the distance between the affected AV crossing site and the optic disc.},

Full retinal vascular slab OCT-A images were obtained from 94 healthy participants. Capillary loss, at 1\% increments up to 50\%, was simulated by randomly removing capillary segments (1000 iterations of randomized loss for each participant at each percent loss). Thirteen quantitative metrics were calculated for each image: foveal avascular zone (FAZ) area, vessel density, vessel complexity index (VCI), vessel perimeter index (VPI), fractal dimension (FD), and parafoveal intercapillary area (PICA) measurements with and without the FAZ (mean PICA, summed PICA, PICA regularity, and PICA standard deviation [PICA SD]). The sensitivity of each metric was calculated as the percent loss at which 80\% of the iterations for a participant fell outside of two standard deviations from the sample's normative mean.    The most used OCT-A metrics, FAZ area and vessel density, were not significantly different from normative values until 27.69\% and 16.00\% capillary loss, respectively. Across the remaining metrics, metric sensitivity ranged from 6.37\% (PICA SD without FAZ) to 39.78\% (Summed PICA without FAZ).    The sensitivity of vasculature metrics for detecting random capillary loss varies substantially. Further efforts simulating different patterns of capillary loss are needed for comparison. Additionally, mapping the repeatability of metrics over time in a normal population is needed to further define metric sensitivity.    Quantitative metrics vary in their ability to detect vascular abnormalities in OCT-A images. Metric choice in screening studies will need to balance expected capillary abnormalities and the quality of the OCT-A images being used.},

This was a population-based, cross-sectional study comprising 3280 (78.7\% response) ethnic Malays. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was measured with Goldmann applanation tonometry. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP) was measured with a digital automatic blood pressure monitor. Mean ocular perfusion pressure (MOPP) = ⅔(mean arterial pressure − IOP), where mean arterial pressure (MAP) = DBP + ⅓(SBP − DBP), systolic perfusion pressure (SPP) = SBP − IOP, and diastolic perfusion pressure (DPP) = DBP − IOP, was calculated. The diagnosis of OAG was based on International Society for Geographical and Epidemiologic Ophthalmology criteria.    A total of 3261 persons (mean age, 58.7 ± 11 years, including 131 [4.0\%] cases of OAG) were available for analyses. Among persons without glaucoma, the mean ± SD IOP, MOPP, SPP, and DPP were 15.3 ± 3.5, 52.8 ± 9.3, 131.5 ± 23.3, and 64.5 ± 11.3 mm Hg, respectively. Among persons with OAG, the corresponding values were 16.8 ± 5.9, 51.6 ± 10.2, 134.5 ± 24.6, and 61.4 ± 11.5 mm Hg, respectively. In multiple logistic regression models adjusting for IOP, age, sex, and IOP- and BP-lowering treatments, OAG risk was significantly higher in participants with DBP, MOPP, or DPP in the lowest quartile (Q1) than in participants in the highest quartile (Q4) (Q1 vs. Q4: odds ratio [OR], 1.71 [95\% confidence interval (CI), 1.04–2.96] for DBP; OR, 1.73 [95\% CI, 1.05–3.15] for MOPP; OR, 1.75 [95\% CI, 1.02–3.01] for DPP).    Low DBP, low MOPP, and low DPP are independent risk factors for OAG in ethnic Malays, providing further evidence of a vascular mechanism in glaucoma pathogenesis across different populations.},

To measure total retinal blood flow in normal human eyes using Doppler Fourier-domain optical coherence tomography (FD-OCT).

Methods
10 normal people aged 35 to 69 years were measured for the right eye using Doppler FD-OCT. Double circular scans around the optic nerve heads were used. Four pairs of circular scans that transected all retinal branch vessels were completed in 2 s. Total retinal blood flow was obtained by summing the flows in the branch veins. Measurements from the eight scans were averaged. Veins with diameters {\textgreater}33 μm were taken into account.

Results
Total retinal blood flow could be measured in eight of 10 subjects: mean (SD) = 45.6 (3.8) μl/min (range 40.8 to 52.9 μl/min). The coefficient of variation for repeated measurements was 10.5\%. Measured vein diameters ranged from 33.3 to 155.4 μm. The averaged flow speed was 19.3 (2.9) mm/s, which did not correlate with vessel diameter. There was no significant difference between flows in the superior and inferior retinal hemispheres.

Conclusions
Double circular scanning using Doppler FD-OCT is a rapid and reproducible method to measure total retinal blood flow. These flow values are within the range previously established by laser Doppler flowmetry.},

To measure the effect of nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) on retinal branching. To compare vascular branching in healthy and diabetic subjects with established biophysical models.

Methods
Vascular bifurcations in arteries and veins were imaged in 17 NPDR and 26 healthy subjects with the Indiana adaptive optics scanning laser ophthalmoscope (AOSLO). Vessel measurements were grouped according to parent vessel diameters into large (≤50 ∼ {\textless}100 μm) and small (≤20 ∼ {\textless}50 μm) sizes. Vessel diameters and bifurcation angles were measured manually. Vascular diameters were compared with predictions of Murray's law using curve fitting. For analysis of bifurcation angles, two models from Zamir were compared: one based on the power required for blood pumping, the other based on drag force between blood and vascular wall.

Results
For normal larger vessels, the exponent relating the parent and daughter branching diameters was significantly less than the value of 3 predicted by Murray's law (arteries: 2.59; veins: 1.95). In NPDR, the best-fit exponent was close to 3 for arteries but close to 2 in healthy subjects in veins, (arteries: 3.09; veins: 2.16). For both small arteries and veins, diabetics' exponent differed from healthy subjects (P {\textless} 0.01). Bifurcation angles in the healthy subjects (78° ± with a standard error (SE) of 0.9°) were not much different than in NPDR (79° ± SE 1.3°). The model based on minimizing pumping power predicted the measurements better than the one minimizing the vascular drag and lumen surface area.

Conclusions
The relation between parent and daughter branch diameters changes in diabetes, but the branching angles do not.},

In this study, we introduce a five-index quantitative analysis of OCT angiograms in an attempt to detect and assess vascular abnormalities from multiple perspectives. The indices include vessel area density, vessel skeleton density, vessel diameter index, vessel perimeter index, and vessel complexity index. We show the usefulness of the proposed indices with five illustrative cases. Repeatability is tested on both a healthy case and a stable diseased case, giving interclass coefficients smaller than 0.031. The results demonstrate that our proposed quantitative analysis may be useful as a complement to conventional OCTA for the diagnosis of disease and monitoring of treatment.},

  abstract   = {The apparent viscosity of blood flowing through narrow glass tubes decreases strongly with decreasing tube diameter over the range from about 300 μm to about 10 μm. This phenomenon, known as the Fåhraeus–Lindqvist effect, occurs because blood is a concentrated suspension of deformable red blood cells with a typical dimension of about 8 μm. Most of the resistance to blood flow through the circulatory system resides in microvessels with diameters in this range. Apparent viscosity of blood in microvessels in vivo has been found to be significantly higher than in glass tubes with corresponding diameters. Here we review experimental observations of bloodʼs apparent viscosity in vitro and in vivo, and progress towards a quantitative theoretical understanding of the mechanisms involved.
Résumé
La viscosité apparente du sang circulant à travers des tubes en verre décroît fortement quand le diamètre du tube décroît dʼune valeur dʼenviron 300 μm à environ 10 μm. Ce phénomène, connu sous le nom dʼeffet Fåhraeus–Lindqvist, résulte du fait que le sang est une suspension concentrée de globules rouges déformables dʼune dimension typique dʼenviron 8 μm. La majeure partie de la résistance à lʼécoulement sanguin à travers le réseau circulatoire a lieu dans des vaisseaux sanguins ayant à peu près la même taille que les globules rouges. La viscosité apparente du sang dans des microvaisseaux in vivo se trouve être bien plus importante que celle mesurée in vitro dans des tubes en verre de même taille. Nous passons en revue les mesures expérimentales de la viscosité apparente effectuées in vivo et in vitro, ainsi que les progrès théoriques réalisés vers une description quantitative des mécanismes mis en jeu.},

Until now, these measurements have been performed in arbitrary units or in units of ophthalmodynamometric force.

A total of 27 patients with primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) and 27 healthy control subjects were included in the study. The IOP measurement included Goldmann applanation tonometry, whereas the pressure enhancement measurement consisted of contact lens dynamometry.    The pressures are given in mm Hg, and are expressed as the mean ± SD for the control subjects versus the POAG patients: IOP 14.4 ± 2.7 vs. 15.4 ± 2.9, systolic blood pressure 141 ± 20.1 vs. 153 ± 16.5 (P = 0.013), central retinal vein threshold pressure (CRVTP) 11.9 ± 3.8 vs. 16.8 ± 5.0, CRVP 15.0 ± 2.7 vs. 17.9 ± 4.2, and retinal perfusion pressure (PPret) standard 84 ± 12.2 vs. 94 ± 9.1 and new 83 ± 12.2 vs. 91 ± 9.6. The differences in PPret between using the new versus the standard method are 0.55 ± 1.33 vs. −2.5 ± 3.89 (P = 0.041 and P = 0.002, respectively). The PPret was at least 5.0 mm Hg lower in 5 of the 27 POAG patients when the new calculation method was used.    The perfusion pressure in the retina and prelaminar region of the optic nerve head (ONH) may be lower than expected because the CRVP may be higher. The pressure measurement in the central retinal vein may be a step toward a better understanding of ONH pathophysiology.},

  abstract = {Purpose
To examine the distribution of intraocular pressure (IOP) in a normal population and the associations of IOP with other ocular and systemic parameters.

Methods
Out of 3468 participants of the population-based cross-sectional Beijing Eye Study 2011 we selected those individuals without glaucomatous optic neuropathy. The study particpants underwent a detailed ophthalmologic and systemic examination. IOP was measured by air puff non-contact tonometry.

Results
The study included 3135 eyes of 3135 participants with a mean age of 64.1 ± 9.6 years (mean ± standard deviation). The mean IOP was 14.7 ± 2.8 mmHg. The 95\% percentile and 97.5\% percentile of the IOP distribution decreased from 20 mmHg / 21 mmHg in individuals aged 40 to 54 years to 18 mmHg / 19 mmHg in individuals aged ≥80 years. In multivariable analysis, higher IOP was associated with the systemic parameters of younger age (P{\textless}0.001), higher blood concentration of glucose (P = 0.03) and triglycerides (P{\textless}0.001), higher diastolic blood pressure (P{\textless}0.001), higher pulse rate (P = 0.003) and higher quantity of alcohol consumption (P = 0.004), and with the ocular parameters of larger central corneal thickness (P{\textless}0.001), more myopic refractive error (P = 0.01) and steeper anterior corneal curvature radius (P = 0.006). IOP decreased significantly by 0.50 mmHg and 0.76 mmHg for each increase in age by 10 years and each increase in corneal curvature radius by 1.0 mm, respectively. The range of the mean ± 2 standard deviations of the IOP adjusted for the parameters of the multivariable model was 9.0 to 18.1 mmHg versus 9.2–20.2 mmHg for the unadjusted IOP. In the age group of 50 to 55 years, the age-adjusted IOP range (mean ± 2 standard deviations) was 9 to 18 mmHg, and in the age group of ≥75 years, it was 8 to 18 mmHg.

Conclusions
IOP physiologically depends on a multitude of systemic and ocular factors including age and blood pressure. These physiological associations of the IOP may be taken into account in the definition of the normal range of the IOP.},

  abstract   = {Purpose of review
A possible connection between ocular perfusion pressure and open-angle glaucoma (OAG) has been hypothesized. This review summarizes the scientific rationale for the proposed relationship, presents recent data, and outlines potential implications.

Recent findings
Population-based epidemiologic studies found strong relationships between low ocular perfusion pressure and OAG prevalence, as well as OAG incidence. Clinical studies report similar associations between low perfusion pressure and OAG progression. These consistent findings suggest that altered blood flow in the optic disc increases both the risk of OAG development and the progression of established OAG. An underlying factor would be impaired vascular autoregulation, which may lead to poor perfusion in OAG. In contrast, there is conflicting evidence on the possible link of glaucoma to blood pressure/hypertension.

Summary
Current evidence supports the role of vascular factors as part of the multifactorial etiology of OAG. Since ocular perfusion pressure reflects the vascular status at the optic disc, it may be more relevant than systemic blood pressure alone. While the associations of OAG to perfusion pressure are strong, consistent and biologically plausible, they require careful interpretation. The evidence implicating a vascular etiology in OAG is mounting, but the clinical implications for patient management are still uncertain.},

  abstract  = {Aims We examine whether inclusion of artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled retinal vasculometry (RV) improves existing risk algorithms for incident stroke, myocardial infarction (MI) and circulatory mortality.
Methods AI-enabled retinal vessel image analysis processed images from 88 052 UK Biobank (UKB) participants (aged 40–69 years at image capture) and 7411 European Prospective Investigation into Cancer (EPIC)-Norfolk participants (aged 48–92). Retinal arteriolar and venular width, tortuosity and area were extracted. Prediction models were developed in UKB using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression for circulatory mortality, incident stroke and MI, and externally validated in EPIC-Norfolk. Model performance was assessed using optimism adjusted calibration, C-statistics and R2 statistics. Performance of Framingham risk scores (FRS) for incident stroke and incident MI, with addition of RV to FRS, were compared with a simpler model based on RV, age, smoking status and medical history (antihypertensive/cholesterol lowering medication, diabetes, prevalent stroke/MI).
Results UKB prognostic models were developed on 65 144 participants (mean age 56.8; median follow-up 7.7 years) and validated in 5862 EPIC-Norfolk participants (67.6, 9.1 years, respectively). Prediction models for circulatory mortality in men and women had optimism adjusted C-statistics and R2 statistics between 0.75–0.77 and 0.33–0.44, respectively. For incident stroke and MI, addition of RV to FRS did not improve model performance in either cohort. However, the simpler RV model performed equally or better than FRS.
Conclusion RV offers an alternative predictive biomarker to traditional risk-scores for vascular health, without the need for blood sampling or blood pressure measurement. Further work is needed to examine RV in population screening to triage individuals at high-risk.},

The pathophysiology of NDD is still debated, and there is an urgent need to understand the mechanisms behind the onset and progression of these heterogenous diseases. The eye represents a unique window to the brain that can be easily assessed via non-invasive ocular imaging. As such, ocular measurements have been recently considered as potential sources of biomarkers for the early detection and management of NDD. However, the current use of ocular biomarkers in the clinical management of NDD patients is particularly challenging. Specifically, many ocular biomarkers are influenced by local and systemic factors that exhibit significant variation among individuals. In addition, there is a lack of methodology available for interpreting the outcomes of ocular examinations in NDD. Recently, mathematical modeling has emerged as an important tool capable of shedding light on the pathophysiology of multifactorial diseases and enhancing analysis and interpretation of clinical results. In this article, we review and discuss the clinical evidence of the relationship between NDD in the brain and in the eye and explore the potential use of mathematical modeling to facilitate NDD diagnosis and management based upon ocular biomarkers.},

To validate our model, we perform a sensitivity analysis and compare its results to published data.

Retinal microvascular geometry, including arteriolar and venular tortuosity, branching angles, optimality deviation, and length-to-diameter ratio (LDR), were measured from digitized photographs. Associations of these geometric characteristics with diabetes duration, A1C level, systolic blood pressure (SBP), and other risk factors were assessed.Of 1,159 patients enrolled, 944 (81.4\%) had gradable photographs and 170 (14.7\%) had retinopathy. Older age was associated with decreased arteriolar (P = 0.024) and venular (P = 0.002) tortuosity, and female subjects had larger arteriolar branching angle than male subjects (P = 0.03). After adjusting for age and sex, longer diabetes duration was associated with larger arteriolar branching angle (P ≤ 0.001) and increased arteriolar optimality deviation (P = 0.018), higher A1C was associated with increased arteriolar tortuosity (\&gt;8.5 vs. ≤8.5\%, P = 0.008), higher SBP was associated with decreased arteriolar LDR (P = 0.002), and higher total cholesterol levels were associated with increased arteriolar LDR (P = 0.044) and decreased venular optimality deviation (P = 0.044). These associations remained after controlling for A1C, retinal vessel caliber, and retinopathy status and were seen in subjects without retinopathy.Key diabetes-related factors affect retinal microvascular geometry in young type 1 diabetes, even in those without evidence of retinopathy.

HIF transcriptional activity depends on the interaction between its intrinsically disordered C-terminal domain and the transcriptional coactivators CBP/p300. Much effort is currently directed at disrupting protein–protein interactions between disease-associated transcription factors like HIF and their cellular partners. The intrinsically disordered protein CITED2, a direct product of HIF-mediated transcription, functions as a hypersensitive negative regulator that attenuates the hypoxic response by competing allosterically with HIF-1α for binding to CBP/p300. Here, we show that a peptide fragment of CITED2 is taken up by retinal cells and efficiently regulates pathological angiogenesis in murine models of ischemic retinopathy. Both vaso-obliteration (VO) and NV were significantly inhibited in an oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) model following intravitreal injection of the CITED2 peptide. The CITED2 peptide localized to retinal neurons and glia, resulting in decreased expression of HIF target genes. Aflibercept, a commonly used anti-VEGF therapy for retinal neovascular diseases, rescued NV but not VO in OIR. However, a combination of the CITED2 peptide and a reduced dose of aflibercept significantly decreased both NV and VO. In contrast to anti-VEGF agents, the CITED2 peptide can rescue hypoxia-induced retinal NV by modulating the hypoxic response through direct competition with HIF for CBP/p300, suggesting a dual targeting strategy for treatment of ischemic retinal diseases and other neovascular disorders.},

  abstract = {Aging is associated with a broad range of visual impairments that can have dramatic consequences on the quality of life of those impacted. These changes are driven by a complex series of alterations affecting interactions between multiple cellular and extracellular elements. The resilience of many of these interactions may be key to minimal loss of visual function in aging; yet many of them remain poorly understood. In this review, we focus on the relation between retinal neurons and their respective mass transport systems. These metabolite delivery systems include the retinal vasculature, which lies within the inner portion of the retina, and the choroidal vasculature located externally to the retinal tissue. A framework for investigation is proposed and applied to identify the structures and processes determining retinal mass transport at the cellular and tissue levels. Spatial variability in the structure of the retina and changes observed in aging are then harnessed to explore the relation between variations in neuron populations and those seen among retinal metabolite delivery systems. Existing data demonstrate that the relation between inner retinal neurons and their mass transport systems is different in nature from that observed between the outer retina and choroid. The most prominent structural changes observed across the eye and in aging are seen in Bruch’s membrane, which forms a selective barrier to mass transfers at the interface between the choroidal vasculature and the outer retina.},

Quantitative comparisons of microaneurysm number, capillary density and capillary diameter were performed between eight human donor eyes with nonproliferative DR and six age- and eccentricity-matched normal donor eyes after retinal vascular perfusion labelling. The parafovea, 3-mm, 6-mm, and 9-mm retinal eccentricities were analyzed and associations between microvascular alterations defined.    Mean capillary density was reduced in all retina regions in the DR group (P = 0.013). Microaneurysms occurred in all retina regions in the DR group, but the association between decreased capillary density and microaneurysm number was only significant in the 3-mm (P = 0.040) and 6-mm (P = 0.007) eccentricities. The mean capillary diameter of the DR group (8.9 ± 0.53 µm) was greater than the control group (7.60 ± 0.40 µm; P = 0.033). There was no association between capillary diameter increase and capillary density decrease (P = 0.257) and capillary diameter increase and microaneurysm number (P = 0.147) in the DR group. Within the parafovea of the DR group, capillary density was significantly reduced, and capillary diameter was significantly increased in the deep capillary plexus compared with the superficial and intermediate plexuses (all P \&lt; 0.05).    In DR, capillary density reduction occurs across multiple retina eccentricities with a predilection for the deep capillary plexus. The association between microaneurysm number and capillary density is specific to retina eccentricity. Capillary diameter increase may be an early biomarker of DR.

  abstract   = {The central role of the cardiovascular system is to maintain adequate capillary perfusion. The spatially and temporally heterogeneous nature of capillary perfusion has been reported in some organs. However, such heterogeneous perfusion properties have not been sufficiently explored in the retina. Arguably, spatial and temporal heterogeneity of capillary perfusion could be more predominant in the retina than that in other organs. This is because the retina is one of the highest metabolic demand neural tissues yet it has a limited blood supply due to optical requirements. In addition, the unique heterogeneous distribution of retinal neural cells within different layers and regions, and the significant heterogeneity of intraretinal oxygen distribution and consumption add to the complexity. Retinal blood flow distribution must match consumption of nutrients such as oxygen and glucose within the retina at the cellular level in order to effectively maintain cell survival and function. Sophisticated local blood flow control in the microcirculation is likely required to control the retinal capillary perfusion to supply local retinal tissue and accommodate temporal and spatial variations in metabolic supply and demand. The authors would like to update the knowledge of the retinal microvessel and capillary network and retinal oxidative metabolism from their own studies and the work of others. The coupling between blood supply and energy demands in the retina is particularly interesting. We will mostly describe information regarding the retinal microvessel network and retinal oxidative metabolism relevant to the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of capillary perfusion. We believe that there is significant and necessary spatial and temporal heterogeneity and active regulation of retinal blood flow in the retina, particularly in the macular region. Recently, retinal optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) has been widely used in ophthalmology, both experimentally and clinically. OCTA could be a valuable tool for examining retinal microvessel and capillary network structurally and has potential for determining retinal capillary perfusion and its control. We have demonstrated spatial and temporal heterogeneity of capillary perfusion in the retina both experimentally and clinically. We have also found close relationships between the smallest arterioles and capillaries within paired arterioles and venules and determined the distribution of smooth muscle cell contraction proteins in these vessels. Spatial and temporal heterogeneity of retinal capillary perfusion could be a useful parameter to determine retinal microvessel regulatory capability as an early assay for retinal vascular diseases. This topic will be of great interest, not only for the eye but also other organs. The retina could be the best model for such investigations. Unlike cerebral vessels, retinal vessels can be seen even at the capillary level. The purpose of this manuscript is to share our current understanding with the readers and encourage more researchers and clinicians to investigate this field. We begin by reviewing the general principles of microcirculation properties and the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of the capillary perfusion in other organs, before considering the special requirements of the retina. The local heterogeneity of oxygen supply and demand in the retina and the need to have a limited and well-regulated retinal circulation to preserve the transparency of the retina is discussed. We then consider how such a delicate balance of metabolic supply and consumption is achieved. Finally we discuss how new imaging methodologies such as optical coherence tomography angiography may be able to detect the presence of spatial and temporal heterogeneity of capillary perfusion in a clinical setting. We also provide some new information of the control role of very small arterioles in the modulation of retinal capillary perfusion which could be an interesting topic for further investigation.},

We present here a novel algorithmic approach that generates highly realistic digital models of human retinal blood vessels based on established biophysical principles, including fully-connected arterial and venous trees with a single inlet and outlet. This approach, using physics-informed generative adversarial networks (PI-GAN), enables the segmentation and reconstruction of blood vessel networks that requires no human input and out-performs human labelling. Our findings highlight the potential of PI-GAN for accurate retinal vasculature characterization, with implications for improving early disease detection, monitoring disease progression, and improving patient care.},

  abstract = {Purpose
To investigate distances from retinal capillaries to arterioles or venules noninvasively.

Methods
An adaptive optics scanning laser ophthalmoscope (AOSLO) and optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) imager acquired detailed maps of retinal vasculature. Using OCTA, we quantified the distance from the edge of an arteriole or venule to the middle of the nearest capillaries (periarteriole or perivenule capillary-free zones, respectively) within the superficial vascular plexus of 20 young healthy subjects with normal axial lengths. These distances were compared to AOSLO images for three subjects. We tested the relation between the peripheral capillary-free zones and FAZ horizontal, vertical, effective diameters, and asymmetry indices in the deep vascular plexus. We examined enlargement with OCTA of capillary-free zones in a type 2 diabetic patient.

Results
The periarteriole capillary-free zone (67.2 ± 25.3 μm) was readily visible and larger than the perivenule capillary-free zone (42.7 ± 14.4 μm), F(1, 998) = 771, P {\textless} 0.0001. The distance from foveal center (P = 0.003) and diameter (P = 0.048) were predictive of perivenule capillary-free zone values. OCTA and AOSLO corresponded for arterioles. FAZ effective diameter was positively associated with asymmetry indices, r = 0.49, P = 0.028, but not peripheral capillary-free zones, although focal enlargements were found in a diabetic patient.

Conclusions
For normal retinas, periarteriole and perivenule capillary-free zones are readily visible with OCTA and AOSLO. Periarteriole capillary-free zones were larger, consistent with arterioles carrying oxygen rich blood that diffuses to support the retina.},

  abstract = {This paper deals with computations of sensitivity indices in sensitivity analysis. Given a mathematical or computational model y=f(x1,x2,…,xk), where the input factors xi's are uncorrelated with one another, one can see y as the realization of a stochastic process obtained by sampling each of the xi from its marginal distribution. The sensitivity indices are related to the decomposition of the variance of y into terms either due to each xi taken singularly (first order indices), as well as into terms due to the cooperative effects of more than one xi. In this paper we assume that one has computed the full set of first order sensitivity indices as well as the full set of total-order sensitivity indices (a fairly common strategy in sensitivity analysis), and show that in this case the same set of model evaluations can be used to compute double estimates of: \&\#x02022;the total effect of two factors taken together, for all such k2 couples, where k is the dimensionality of the model;\&\#x02022;the total effect of k−2 factors taken together, for all k2 such (k−2) ples. We further introduce a new strategy for the computation of the full sets of first plus total order sensitivity indices that is about 50\% cheaper in terms of model evaluations with respect to previously published works. We discuss separately the case where the input factors xi's are not independent from each other.},

  abstract = {Treating retinal diseases to prevent sight loss is an increasingly important challenge. Thanks to the configuration of the eye, the retina can be examined relatively easily in situ. Owing to recent technological development in scanning devices, much progress has been made in understanding the structure of the retina and characterising retinal biomarkers. However, treatment options remain limited and are often of low efficiency and efficacy. In recent years, the concept of in silico clinical trials (ISCTs) has been adopted by many pharmaceutical companies to optimise and accelerate the development of therapeutics. ISCTs rely on the use of mathematical models based on the physical and biochemical mechanisms underpinning a biological system. With appropriate simplifications and assumptions, one can generate computer simulations of various treatment regimens, new therapeutic molecules, delivery strategies and so forth, rapidly and at a fraction of the cost required for the equivalent experiments. Such simulations have the potential not only to hasten the development of therapies and strategies but also to optimise the use of existing therapeutics. In this paper, we review the state-of-the-art in in silico models of the retina for mathematicians, biomedical scientists and clinicians, highlighting the challenges to developing ISCTs. Throughout this paper, we highlight key findings from in silico models about the physiology of the retina in health and disease. We describe the main building blocks of ISCTs and identify challenges to developing ISCTs of retinal diseases.},

  abstract   = {Historically, the evidences of safety and efficacy that companies provide to regulatory agencies as support to the request for marketing authorization of a new medical product have been produced experimentally, either in vitro or in vivo. More recently, regulatory agencies started receiving and accepting evidences obtained in silico, i.e. through modelling and simulation. However, before any method (experimental or computational) can be acceptable for regulatory submission, the method itself must be considered “qualified” by the regulatory agency. This involves the assessment of the overall “credibility” that such a method has in providing specific evidence for a given regulatory procedure. In this paper, we describe a methodological framework for the credibility assessment of computational models built using mechanistic knowledge of physical and chemical phenomena, in addition to available biological and physiological knowledge; these are sometimes referred to as “biophysical” models. Using guiding examples, we explore the definition of the context of use, the risk analysis for the definition of the acceptability thresholds, and the various steps of a comprehensive verification, validation and uncertainty quantification process, to conclude with considerations on the credibility of a prediction for a specific context of use. While this paper does not provide a guideline for the formal qualification process, which only the regulatory agencies can provide, we expect it to help researchers to better appreciate the extent of scrutiny required, which should be considered early on in the development/use of any (new) in silico evidence.},

The specific relationship between blood flow rate, F, and vessel diameter, D, was determined for both retinal arteries and retinal veins. On average, F increased with increasing D at a power of 4.1, consistent with the presence of Poiseuille flow. In six eyes of six subjects, measurements on individual vessels were combined to yield the total retinal blood flow rate. The mean and standard deviation of the total retinal blood flow was 80 +/- 12 microliter/min. The blood flow rate per unit mass of retinal tissue was calculated and found to be in good agreement with that reported for macaque monkeys. Blood flow to the temporal side of the retina was approximately three times larger than to the nasal side. There was no significant difference between blood flow to the superior and the inferior retina.},
